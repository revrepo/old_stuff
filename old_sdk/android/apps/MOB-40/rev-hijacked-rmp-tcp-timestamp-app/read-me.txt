This app uses SDKv1.3-dev (Developer's version)

This app is to compare the timestamps between TCP and RMP communications.

It takes a url as input. And takes the decision from user whether to transport the communication over RMP or TCP (from the check box).
After pressing "Send Request" button the app communicates with the server and displays the webpage on the screen. 
Also after complete data download it displays the timestamp statistics in a pop-up.

Note: 
In case of TCP. First chunk/byte received time cannot be measured, so it always displayes 0(Zero).
In case of RMP please make sure that udt-server is running.
